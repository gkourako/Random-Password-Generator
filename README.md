# Random-Password-Generator
The third homework assignment introducing us to JavaScript.

I demonstrated my ability to use functions, for loops, and arrays in JavaScript to create a random password generator.  I used one array with an empty object to push the choices to and an empty string to generate the password.  I demonstrated my new found love for the .split command.
